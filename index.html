            <p>
                Coming from a non-technical background, my curiosity and desire to expand my knowledge led me to Cloud Engineering. With the support and guidance from <strong>Azubi Africa</strong>, I was able to acquire valuable cloud skills that have opened up new possibilities for my career.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I am excited to combine these new technical skills with my educational background in Economics and Financial Risk Management to create solutions that stand out in today’s competitive market. This journey is just beginning, and I am determined to continue growing and making a positive impact in the cloud space.
